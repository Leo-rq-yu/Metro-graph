In the first week, we talk about the problem that we are able to solve by using searching algorithms. We also brifly think about the way of implementation of our program and analyze the time complexity.
In the second week we get our hands on implementation of our code. A graph class and other necessary subclasses have been constructed and the information are read to organize the bascis strualcture that is going to use
In the third week, we finished writing the BFS and Floyed Warshal algorithem.
in the fourth week, we write the test cases and debug for our code.
